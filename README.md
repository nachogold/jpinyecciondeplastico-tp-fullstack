Website I made for a local plastic business.

This was a mid-term assignment in a Fullstack web development course I undertook during the second half of 2021.
The project allowed me to put into practice the front-end skills I learned (or continued learning) during the first half of the course.
These include: HTML, CSS (incl. Bootstrap) and JavaScript.

This is the first website I developed and it was my formal entrance into the web development field.
