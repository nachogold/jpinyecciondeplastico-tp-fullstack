Website I made for a local plastic business.

This was a mid-term assignment in a Fullstack web development course I undertook during the second half of 2021.
The project allowed me to put into practice the front-end skills I learned during the first half of the course.
These include: HTML, CSS (incl. Bootstrap) and JavaScript.
